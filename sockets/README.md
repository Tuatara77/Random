# Server.py

This is the server that all clients connect to

# Client-ptp.py

The client program which connects to server.py. The ptp hints to how it initially would've been peer-to-peer, but that didn't end up happening


# Client.py

This is an older (and therefore more messy) version of client-ptp.py. I don't recommend using it
